    "# Starbucks Capstone Project  \n",
    "I was intrigued by the promotional offers that companies like Starbucks give to its customers. I was interested to know if the offers given by Starbucks really made any difference in thier sale, or how do the offers affect customer behavior but most importantly i wanted to know how much any customer spend at Starbucks. So, I decided to explore myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "In this project i will be trying to predict the amount of product a customer will purchase based on various parameters, including the offers given to the customer. This makes it a supervised learning regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metrics:  \n",
    "I will be using **Root mean squared error (RMSE)** as the metric to evaluate my model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Why did I choose RMSE as the metric ?**   \n",
    "Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are; RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some advantages in using RMSE:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) It is simple and intuitive to understand for a layman as it has the same units as that of target value. It simply means how far our predictions are from the actual values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) It is easy and not computationally expensive to calculate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Since we are squaring the values, hence the positive and negative error values do not cancel out.    \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Since the errors are squared before they are averaged, the RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors compared to small errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5) RMSE is the default metric of many models because loss function defined in terms of RMSE is smoothly differentiable and makes it easier to perform mathematical operations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I looked at some other options like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), Mean Squared Error(MSE), R-Squared; but found RMSE better suited to my purpose because:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Which simply means MAE gives equal weight to large errors as well as small errors. Hence, RMSE is more useful when large errors are particularly undesirable, which was my case. Also, MAE takes the absolute value, which is undesirable in many mathematical calculations.    \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Mean Bias Error (MBE):** If the absolute value is not taken in MAE (the signs of the errors are not removed), the average error becomes the Mean Bias Error (MBE) and is usually intended to measure average model bias. MBE can convey useful information, but should be interpreted cautiously because positive and negative errors will cancel out. Which for our purpose is not desired.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** RMSE is just the square root of the MSE. Thus, tt do not have the same units as that of target value, but the square of them. Therefore, i did not used it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4) **R-Square:** R-squared says nothing about prediction error. We cannot use R-squared to determine whether the coefficient estimates and predictions are biased, which is why one must assess the residual plots. R-squared does not necessarily indicate if a regression model provides an adequate fit to your data. A good model can have a low R2 value. On the other hand, a biased model can have a high R2 value. Therefore, i did not use R-square as metric\n"

    "### 1) Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Also, not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. Informational offers also have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, it is assumed that the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it should be kept in mind that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",

    "### Discussion about the final predictor (model):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I have made a pipeline of MinMaxScaler() and XGBoost Regressor(). I have fitted this pipeline on the training data and the used this pipeline to make final predictions on the testing data as well as training data. Finally, i calculated the RMSE on my predictions. Testing error got decreased from our baseline model testing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Making a pipeline makes our model really robust and easy to use. It has the following advantages:  \n",
    "i) We can fit and predict on the pipeline. So, the Scaling and final model predictions happen in one step only, instead of first scaling the data and then using model to make predictions.  \n",
    "ii) Use of MinMaxScaler() for standardising our data through a pipeline fits on our train data and transforms it. But it only transforms (and not fits again) the test data when pipeline is used for predicting. So, on one hand we don't have to call fit and transform on train data and onlt transform on the test data seperately (which saves effort); and on the other hand, this does not allow information from testing data creeping into the training data when we are using GridSearchCV() to find the best parameters for our model. It makes our model robust to such information leakage errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I have used MinMaxScaler() to standardise my data in (0,1) range, so that all the features have the same scale of the data and hence do not affect our model adversely. Having features data present in different scale of values can severely decrease model performance. Hence, the model react to small changes in the dataset quite well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Estimator in my pipeline is XGBoost Regressor() which is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. It has several advantages which makes it very robust. They are:    \n",
    "i) Regularization: XGBoost has in-built L1 (Lasso Regression) and L2 (Ridge Regression) regularization which prevents the model from overfitting.  \n",
    "ii) Handling Missing Values: XGBoost has an in-built capability to handle missing values. When XGBoost encounters a missing value at a node, it tries both the left and right hand split and learns the way leading to higher loss for each node. It then does the same when working on the testing data.  \n",
    "iii) Effective Tree Pruning: A GBM would stop splitting a node when it encounters a negative loss in the split. Thus it is more of a greedy algorithm. XGBoost on the other hand make splits upto the max_depth specified and then start pruning the tree backwards and remove splits beyond which there is no positive gain.  \n",
    "iv) Parallel Processing: XGBoost utilizes the power of parallel processing and that is why it is much faster than GBM. It uses multiple CPU cores to execute the model.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I have used GridSearchCV() to find the best parameters for my model. It uses the default **3-fold cross validation** for its task. This makes my pipeline easily adjustable to any change in the data, as then in this stage the model will get optimised for that data only. This combined with use of pipeline makes the whole process robust.     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The robustness of the model can be evaluated by observing that the testing RMSE got reduced compared to our baseline results.  \n",
